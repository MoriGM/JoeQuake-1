### Rich mod support

JoeQuake has support for FitzQuake and RMQ (Remake Quake) protocols. Modern mods and maps are developed using the standards which these protocols defined: larger number of models and sounds, transparent entities, scalable sized entities, higher precision view angles, etc. just to name the more important ones.

JoeQuake has a dedicated **Mods** main menu which shows all the Quake subdirectories, and choosing any of them reloads the specific mod immediately (as if you have started Quake `-game <moddir>`).

The following mods are fully supported by JoeQuake:
- [Arcane dimensions](https://www.moddb.com/mods/arcane-dimensions)
- Dimension of the Machine (from [Quake Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/Quake/))

### Maps, Demos, Mods menu

JoeQuake added 3 new menus to Quake:
* The **Maps** menu contains a list of all available maps in the actual path
including inside pak files as well.
* The **Demos** menu gives you a shell about all the Quake subdirectories, and you
may browse between these dirs and watch demos in any folder.
* The **Mods** menu also shows all the Quake subdirectories, and choosing any of them
reloads the specific mod immediately (as if you have started Quake `-game <moddir>`)
